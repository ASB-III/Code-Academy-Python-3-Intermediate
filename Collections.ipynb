    "#### 1. Our business has been doing well over the past year and we have been provided with a list of dictionaries representing the amount of profit per month as well as additional profit from holidays when applicable. We want an easy way to monitor our profit over the most recent 12 month period. To do this, we can use the ChainMap class. This will allow us to conserve historical data while also allowing us to retrieve the most recent data. It will even allow us to work with additional keys within dictionary updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, remember to import ChainMap. Then create a new ChainMap called profit_map using the year_profit_data list. Remember that a ChainMap accepts a variable number of arguments so we need to expand the list (*) so the constructor will read them as individual arguments instead of one single argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hint</b><br>\n",
    "Remember to expand a list in python using an asterisk. This will look like: ChainMap(*year_profit_data).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. For the next step, we need logic which will be able to calculate the normal profits and the holiday profits separately. Create a function called get_profits which calculates the sum of the standard profits (keys not containing 'holiday') and the holiday profits (keys containing 'holiday') in two different variables. Make this function return the two variables: the standard profit first and the holiday profit second. Additionally, call the function using the profit_map and store the results in variables called last_year_standard_profit and last_year_holiday_profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hint</b><br>\n",
    "When creating this function, you can loop through each of the keys in the ChainMap since it is treated like one big dictionary. If 'holiday' is in the key, then add the value to the total count for the holiday profit, otherwise add the value to the standard profit. remember to return both values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \n",
    "3. It has been three months and our accountant has sent three more months worth of profit data in the form of a list of dictionaries called new_months_data. Add the new mappings to the profit_map so that the old January - March months are still in the ChainMap, but accessing those keys will return data for the most recent three months. Call the get_profits function on the profit_map again and store the results in current_year_standard_profit and current_year_holiday_profit to calculate the sum of the most recent 12 months of profit data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hint</b><br>\n",
    "Remember to add new dictionaries to the profit_map instead of updating the first dictionary in the group of mappings. To do this you can use .new_child(new_dictionary). Keep in mind that this method returns a new ChainMap object, so you will need to replace the old version of profit_map.\n",

We even learned how to make our own advanced containers using container wrappers. Let’s review the use case for each of the advanced containers from the collections class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- deque\n",
    "    - An advanced container which is optimized for appending and popping items from the front and back. For accessing many elements positioned elsewhere, it is better to use a list.\n",
    "- namedtuple\n",
    "    - The namedtuple lets us create an immutable data structure similar to a tuple, but we don’t have to access the stored data using indices. Instead, we can create instances of our namedtuple with named attributes. We can then use the . operator to retrieve data by the attribute names.\n",
    "- Counter\n",
    "    - This advanced container automatically counts the data within a hashable object which we pass into it’s constructor. It stores it as a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are the number of occurrences.\n",
    "- defaultdict\n",
    "    - An advanced container which behaves like a regular dictionary, except that it does not throw an error when trying to access a key which does not exist. Instead, it creates a new key:value pair where the value defaults to what we provide in the constrictor for the defaultdict.\n",
    "- OrderedDict\n",
    "    - The OrderedDict combines the functionality of a list and a dict by preserving the order of elements, but also allowing us to access values using keys without having to provide an index for the position of stored dictionaries.\n",
    "- ChainMap\n",
    "    - This interesting container combines multiple mappings into a single container. When accessing a value using a key, it will search through every mapping contained within until a match is found or the end is reached. It also provides some useful methods for grouping parent and child mappings.\n",
    "- UserDict\n",
    "    - This is a container wrapper which lets us create our own version of a dictionary\n",
    "- UserList\n",
    "    - This is a container wrapper which lets us create our own version of a list\n",
