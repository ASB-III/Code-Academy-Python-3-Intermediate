    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- in Python we always use these open and closed parentheses and you might be wondering what exactly these do essentially when you put an open and close parenthesis after a function it indicates that we want to call the function so we want to execute all of the code inside potentially with some in arguments\n",

    "\n",
    "here in this fifth section I want to\n",
    "talk to you about Python decorators so\n",
    "we saw how we can create a decorator\n",
    "function but there's a way of doing this\n",
    "in Python which is actually really easy\n",
    "so the the complicated syntax is down\n",
    "here right this is kind of annoying\n",
    "where we have to wrap this function over\n",
    "here we have to pass it into the\n",
    "decorator it's it's this very like\n",
    "tedious and manual process right to\n",
    "doing all of this I can actually get rid\n",
    "of all of this and up here I can just\n",
    "make an @ sign and then I can type in\n",
    "the name of the decorator so I can type\n",
    "in title decorator and now check this\n",
    "out if I just go print my name if I\n",
    "execute print my name it's actually\n",
    "going to decorate it automatically so\n",
    "you'll see here we're printing out\n",
    "professor Mike so it'll do all of this\n",
    "code for us right all of this is going\n",
    "to be done in the background like python\n",
    "will take care of that\n",
    "and we can just call the function\n",
    "normally so you put this decorator\n",
    "annotation right above the function so\n",
    "it has to go directly above here and\n",
    "then we're able to use that so I can do\n",
    "the same thing for print Joe's name so\n",
    "right now if I did print Joe's name and\n",
    "I tried to execute this you see it just\n",
    "says Joe but if I wanted I can decorate\n",
    "it with the title decorator and now when\n",
    "I print this out you'll see we get that\n",
    "title so that's how decorators work and\n",
    "the main concept that you really need to\n",
    "understand here is this idea of a\n",
    "wrapper function that gets both defined\n",
    "and returned from the decorator function\n",
    "this wrapper function is very important\n",
    "because it's this wrapper function which\n",
    "allows us to package up additional\n",
    "functionality with the functionality\n",
    "that's given to us in the form of our\n",
    "print name function and so these\n",
    "decorators can have a lot of different\n",
    "uses and as you learn more about Python\n",
    "you'll discover more and more useful\n",
    "decorators and so a lot of times a\n",
    "decorator like this would be defined in\n",
    "a separate file it might even be defined\n",
    "in some sort of a library file that you\n",
    "might have to download with pip or\n",
    "something and the whole point of is it\n",
    "kind of gets abstracted away so all you\n",
    "have to worry about is just doing this\n",
    "decorator annotation and then it sort of\n",
    "works for you\n",
    "\n",
    "6. decorators w/ parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "to kind\n",
    "of clean this up a bit let's say that\n",
    "the print name function I wanted this to\n",
    "be able to take in a name so the print\n",
    "my name it should be able to take in a\n",
    "name and then down here we'll just print\n",
    "the name so we can kind of customize\n",
    "what the name is so in here I could pass\n",
    "in like Shelby and now if I run this and\n",
    "notice that I got rid of the decorator I\n",
    "commented it out now when I run this\n",
    "you'll see that we just print out Shelby\n",
    "so I can pass in whatever name I want to\n",
    "pass in but if I put this decorator back\n",
    "in we're actually gonna get an error and\n",
    "you'll see what happens in a\n",
    "again see we're getting a type error so\n",
    "rapper this function over here doesn't\n",
    "take any positional arguments but we\n",
    "gave it the name so if I want to be able\n",
    "to accept arguments here in my function\n",
    "that's getting decorated. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>I have to get a\n",
    "little bit fancier with my syntax so\n",
    "over here all we have to do here inside\n",
    "of the wrapper is we're just going to\n",
    "put args and then we're gonna put KW\n",
    "args and so we can put that right there\n",
    "and then we're also going to pass that\n",
    "in here when we execute our print named\n",
    "function so all you have to do is just. \n",
    "what that'll do is it'll pass in any\n",
    "of the parameters I need the arguments\n",
    "that were passed into the print name\n",
    "function into the wrapper function and\n",
    "then the wrapper function will then pass\n",
    "them into the print name function so the\n",
    "the parameters the arguments basically\n",
    "just get piped through this function\n",
    "structure and we'll be able to use that\n",
    "so now if I was to run my program and\n",
    "whoops you have to put two stars here\n",
    "two asterisks.<br>\n",
    "and you'll see that it gets decorated\n",
    "just fine and you could put other\n",
    "parameters in here too so for example if\n",
    "I put in like an age I could say we\n",
    "could print out their age and then over\n",
    "here we if we pass in an age\n",
    "you'll see that it does that just fine\n",
    "so basically you can have you know as\n",
    "many arguments as you want and they'll\n",
    "get passed through this structure so\n",
    "that's gonna do it for my explanation on\n",
    "decorators and Python and really when it\n",
    "comes down to it decorators are just\n",
    "fancy ways of working with functions so\n",
    "as you saw in our decorating a function\n",
    "section section four we don't need this\n",
    "fancy you know @ symbol syntax we don't\n",
    "need that syntax in order to use\n",
    "decorators but it does make it a lot\n",
    "easier and a lot simpler because we\n",
    "don't have as much complex syntax so\n",
    "this is kind of what we would call\n",
