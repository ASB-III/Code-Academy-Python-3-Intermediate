    "You are a new teacher at Pine Valley Elementary School!\n",

    "This project will help you practice and further master the learned material from the Iterables and Iterators lesson by utilizing the information learned to set up and organize your new classroom and roster of students.\n",

    "Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off\n",
    "Working with Iterables\n",
    "#### 1. It’s the first day of summer and you have a new incoming class of elementary students to prepare for in the coming months!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, look at the code in roster.py. You have been provided a roster of students for the 10 children in your class. Each child’s record contains name, age, height (in inches), favorite classroom subject, and favorite animal to help you get to know them better.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve learned that an iterable is simply a Python object that can be traversed. This list of dictionaries is your first iterable. Navigate to script.py and import the student_roster list from roster.py. Create an iterator for the student_roster list and print out each student’s information using next().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hint</b><br>\n",
    "The built-in function next() can retrieve the next value in an iterator. The print (variable) statement can be used to print out the output of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Now that we know a little more about the students in our classroom, let’s start organizing the classroom! First, we should create a custom class that will allow us to manage our classroom and students.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve been provided a file called classroom_organizer.py. Start defining out your custom ClassroomOrganizer class.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we should import the student_roster list from the roster.py file so that we can utilize it within our custom class. Another module we will need later on will be the itertools module. Let’s import these both into the classroom_organizer.py file now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hint</b><br>\n",
    "To import modules, use the syntax:"
