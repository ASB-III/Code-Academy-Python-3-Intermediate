    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Create a generator function called graduation_countdown() that will countdown the number of days left before student graduation. It should take in as input days and yield one less day on each next() call until 0 is reached. Use a while loop for yielding and decrementing the day.\n",
    "\n",

    "<b>Hint</b><br>\n",
    "Use the range(days, -1, -1) function to generate the values in a descending order.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hint</b><br>\n",
    "An if statement can check if days_left is None. If it is not None, that means a value has been sent to the generator via send() and we can replace our days variable with this value.\n",
