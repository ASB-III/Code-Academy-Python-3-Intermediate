A list for example has append and remove operations that change the elements of the list. Sets and dictionaries are also two other mutable objects in Python as they can be changed on the fly.\n",

    "\n",
    "It might be helpful to note some of the objects in Python that are not mutable (and therefore OK to use as default arguments). int, float, and other numbers can’t be mutated (arithmetic operations will return a new number). Tuples are a kind of immutable list, and strings are also immutable since operations that update a string will all return a completely new string.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Default parameter values are evaluated from left to right when the function definition is executed.</b> This means that the expression is evaluated once, when the function is defined, and that the same “pre-computed” value is used for each call.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when we call a function, the default values we provide for parameters are only created once, and used for each subsequent call of the function. This means our grades=[] from our earlier function was only created once and anytime we tried to access it, the same list was being modified. We can even see that the memory id of the grades property for both students is the same (using the built-in id() function):"
