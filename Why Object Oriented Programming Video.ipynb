    "class into the deadline task class but\n",
    "thanks to inheritance we actually don't\n",
    "as I mentioned inheritance allows a\n",
    "class to inherit all of the attributes\n",

    "the deadlines tasks inherit all of the\n",
    "attributes and functionality of the task\n",
    "class this means that we don't have to\n",
    "re-implement or rewrite any of that\n",
    "logic all of that will automatically be\n",
    "available to any of the code interacting\n",
    "with a deadline task therefore users of\n",

    "complete or incomplete just like with a\n",
    "normal task without us having to rewrite\n",

    "a deadline task a more specific type of\n",
    "task which inherits all the\n",
    "functionality and attributes of the\n",

    "my deadline tasks in order to understand\n",
    "polymorphism we have to look at these\n",
    "objects in terms of their datatypes\n",
    "remember that when we create a class\n",
    "we're actually creating a new data type\n",
    "the first object my task is the task\n",
    "data type it's an implementation of the\n",
    "task class which makes it a task type\n",
    "the second object my deadline task is a\n",
    "deadlines task data type it implements\n",
    "the deadlines class but because the\n",
    "deadline tasks inherits all of the\n",
    "attributes and functionality of the task\n",
    "class the my deadlines task object is\n",
    "also a task data type if you think about\n",
    "it this makes sense the my deadlines\n",
    "task object has all the same attributes\n",
    "and methods as the my task object along\n",
    "with a few more specific ones related to\n",
    "deadlines so any code that's designed to\n",
    "work with the task object will also be\n",
    "able to work with a deadline task object\n",
    "\n",
    "this in a nutshell is polymorphism it's\n",
    "what allows us to use either a normal\n",
    "task object or a more specific deadline\n",
    "task object in our programs\n",
